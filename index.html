    <h1> Influence of Physical Attributes on NBA Player Performance </h1>

    <h3> Introduction </h3>

    <p> Our project delves into assessing the impact of physical attributes such as height, weight, and age 
        on NBA player performance. With the continuous evolution of basketball, the physical profile of the 
        ideal NBA player is ever-changing, influencing not just on-court strategies but also critical management 
        decisions such as scouting and team building. By meticulously examining a rich array of demographic, 
        biometric, and performance data, our analysis aims to unearth correlations between physical traits and 
        player success, thereby shaping future strategies in player development and team composition. These 
        insights will provide valuable perspectives for both basketball professionals and enthusiasts, guiding 
        their understanding and strategic approaches in the evolving landscape of the sport.
    </p>

    <h3> Data </h3>

    <p> Our study is underpinned by an extensive dataset containing detailed records of over 12,000 NBA players 
        from the 1996-2022 seasons. This dataset, updated most recently on October 13, 2023, to include the latest 
        season data, comprises 12,844 observations with 21 detailed attributes such as player height, weight, age, 
        points scored, rebounds, and assists. Sourced from Kaggle and meticulously supplemented with data from the 
        NBA Stats API and Basketball-Reference for missing entries, our dataset offers a profound basis for both 
        foundational and advanced statistical analysis. The comprehensive nature of this data not only allows for a 
        longitudinal analysis over the span of nearly three decades but also supports a nuanced exploration of how 
        physical attributes impact player performance and team dynamics across different basketball eras.

    <p> Meanwhile, we believe that geographical information is important when exploring the physical attributes of NBA players. 
        Therefore, we make use of geographical information on the <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/">Natural Earth</a>,
        which is needed to make maps for the world.
    </p>

    <p> To make a better data visualization, we create two different 
        layers for the average height and the average weight in each country.
        Following is an interactive map for the all the countries in the world. 
        User can zoom in the map. The depth color for each layer indicates 
        the average height and weight for each country. When click any
        country, the name and its average NBA players height and weight will be revealed.
    </p>

        <iframe src="geography.html" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="10"></iframe>
    </div>

    <p> In general, countries mainly send centers and big forwards tend to have higher
        average height and weight like China for example. On the other hand, countries
        mainly provide point guards and shooting guards tend to have lower average 
        height and weight than the others like United States for example. Lastly, countries
        mainly give small forwards tend to have relatively high average height and low weight
        like Russia and Germany.
    </p>

    <h3> Overview of Players' Heights And Weights </h3>

    <p> We primarily consider physical performance will be a scale 
        to select NBA players. For this reason, 
        we leverage bar plots with distribution of heights and weights by d3 
        to explore the exact influencing factors.
    </p>

    <div class="container">
        <div id="height-chart-container"></div>
        <div class="text">
            <p> The first plot presents the distribution of heights over all NBA players,
                which is negatively skewed due to some extreme shorter heights at the left side tail.
                The straight lines in orange demostrated the average heights of NBA players,
                 which rounds about 201 cm. And the straight lines in purple is 
                 the mean heights of US male adults, which is about 175cm. 
                 Most of NBA players' heights are much more higher than the US male adults' 
                 average height. It indicates that to be a NBA player, height is one of 
                 the influence factors.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="text">
            <p> The second plot presents the distribution of weights over all NBA players,
                which is practically symmetric and normal distribution. The straight lines 
                in orange demostrated the average weights of NBA players,which rounds about 100 kg. 
                 And the straight lines in purple is the mean weights of US male adults, 
                 which is about 91 kg. Most of NBA players' weights are heavier than
                 the US male adults' average weight. It indicates that weight is
                 also considered as one of the influence factors.

    <h3> Further Research on Players' Heights and Weights </h3>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="image">
            <img src="correlation.png" height="400px" frameborder="10"></img>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p> The purpose of line plot is to explore the relationship between NBA player heights 
        and weights by time. The correlation at each season is over 0.72, which means 
        there is a strong relationship between NBA player heights and weights. Since 2014, 
        correlation started decreasing to 12 percents. There is still a strong correlation 
        between them, but weaker than the period before 2014.
    </p>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="image">
            <img src="average_height_and_weight.png" height="500px" frameborder="10"></img>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p> The points at each year is located by the average heights and weights for each season 
        from 1996 to 2022. Combined with previous plot, both of them present an decreasing trendency 
        since 2014. For this plot, highest and weights we can observe the curve of NBA player 
        heights and weights lines are similar before 2012. However, since 2012, the change of trendency 
        become converse. This is why correlation decreases 12 percents during this period.
    </p>

    <h3> Physical Attributes and Performance Metrics </h3>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="text">
            <p> Exploring the interplay between physical attributes and performance metrics in professional basketball,
                our correlation matrix heatmap provides a data-driven perspective.
                A robust positive correlation of 0.82 is evident between player height and weight,
                reinforcing common expectations about player physique.
                Delving deeper, the heatmap unveils a moderate positive correlation between player height and rebounding statistics,
                underscoring the advantage taller players possess in securing rebounds. On the flip side,
                the negative correlation between height and assists illuminates the inclination for shorter players
                to engage more frequently in ball distribution and playmaking activities.
            </p>

            <p> These statistical correlations shed light on the fundamental relationships
                between a player's physical characteristics and their gameplay contributions.
                For strategic team management, understanding these correlations is essential for
                maximizing player utility and crafting winning strategies tailored to the physical strengths of the roster.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="all_attr_corr.png" height="550px" frameborder="10"></img>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p> We aslo focus on the evolution of shooting efficiency, as depicted by the true shooting percentage,
        with respect to player height, comparing two distinct basketball eras: before and after 2012.
        True shooting percentage is a comprehensive measure, considering all forms of scoring attempts,
        which provides an integrated assessment of shooting effectiveness.
    </p>

    <p> The side-by-side boxplots distinctly categorize players into height ranges,
        allowing for a direct comparison of shooting performance within specific physical profiles.
        A notable upward trend in both the median and the interquartile range of true shooting percentages post-2012 is observed
        across all height categories. This trend not only signifies an overall improvement in player shooting efficiency
        but also reflects strategic adaptations within the sport that likely emphasize skill development
        and shooting accuracy regardless of a player's stature.
    </p>

    <p> These insights into the dynamics of player performance and game strategy can be pivotal for coaches and analysts
        in adapting training regimens to align with the progressive demands of the sport.
        This comparative visualization serves as a testament to the advancements in basketball techniques
        and the increasingly pivotal role of precision in defining the modern game.
    </p>

        <div class="image">
            <img src="true_shooting_pct.png" height="500px" frameborder="10"></img>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3> Physical Attributes and Performance Metrics Each Season</h3>

    <p> Now combining the metrics and distributions of height and weight each season,
        We create the following interactive plot such that user can choose one of the 
        four lines to see the different correlations between specific physical attributes and
        specific performance in each season.
    </p>

    <div class="center">
        <iframe src="physical_attr_and_perform.html" width="100%" height="750px" frameborder="10"></iframe>
    </div>

    <h3> Conclusion and Future Work </h3>

    <p> After the analysis, we have concluded there exist a transition 
        from big-ball era to small-ball era. The small-ball era is 
        characterized by shorter, more agile players, with a focus 
        on speed, flexibility, and perimeter shooting. the big-ball 
        era is characterized by taller, heavier players, with an 
        emphasis on strength, height advantage, and inside scoring.
    </p>

    <p> For future work, it would be interesting to analyze player 
        skills in addition to physical attributes, and how they 
        contribute to success in different eras. This could include 
        aspects such as shooting accuracy, defensive skills, passing 
        ability, and more. Understanding these factors could provide 
        valuable insights into the evolution of the game and inform 
        strategies for player development and team composition.
